# tutorialtime README

Basically, this was meant to be a tutorial extension in Vs Code where people could watch videos in a tab, but unfortunately VS Code doesnt have FFMPEG meaning such an extension isn't possible. You could technically use a FFMPEG.js library or some variant but the file size and the speed of the extension would be so horrendous and time-consuming, it wouldn't be helpful at all. That's why I stopped working on this project. See the following github issues for more info.

This is the README for your extension "tutorialtime". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
